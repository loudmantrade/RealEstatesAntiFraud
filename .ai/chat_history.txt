Branch: feature/plugin-dependency-graph
Head commit: f677208
Remote: https://github.com/loudmantrade/RealEstatesAntiFraud.git

Purpose: Resume work on this project from another machine using the .ai snapshot.

Summary of recent work included in snapshot:
- Implemented plugin dependency graph (Issue #5) with DAG, Kahn's algorithm, DFS cycle detection.
- Integrated dependency graph into `core/plugin_manager.py` with 3-phase loading.
- Added `export_dot()` visualization.
- Wrote 38 unit tests for `DependencyGraph` (all passing).
- Created integration test skeletons for `PluginManager`.
- Updated `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md` with Plugin Dependencies section.

Files included in `.ai/snapshot/`:
- core/dependency_graph.py
- core/plugin_manager.py (snapshot)
- docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md (snapshot)
- tests/unit/test_dependency_graph.py
- tests/unit/test_plugin_manager_dependencies.py

Untracked files at time of snapshot (git status --porcelain):
- tests/fixtures/plugins/init_error_plugin/plugin.yaml
- tests/fixtures/plugins/test_source_plugin/__init__.py
- tests/unit/test_plugin_manager_dependencies.py

How to resume on another machine
1. Copy the whole repository folder (including the `.ai` directory) to the other machine, or transfer just the `.ai` folder.
   - Recommended: compress the `.ai` directory and move it.

   Example (on source machine):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/RealEstatesAntiFraud
   tar -czf realestates-ai-snapshot.tar.gz .ai
   scp realestates-ai-snapshot.tar.gz user@other-machine:/path/to/project/
   ```

2. On the other machine, extract the snapshot into the project root (same relative path recommended):
   ```bash
   tar -xzf realestates-ai-snapshot.tar.gz -C /path/to/RealEstatesAntiFraud
   ```

3. Inspect `.ai/metadata.json` for environment details (python version, pip freeze) and follow to recreate environment.

4. To continue the chat with Copilot on the other machine, open the repo in VSCode and provide Copilot the path to `.ai/chat_history.txt` (or paste its contents). The chat assistant can then pick up from that snapshot.

Contents of `.ai/chat_history.txt` are human-readable; `.ai/chat_history.json` (also saved) contains structured metadata for easier automated resume.

Notes:
- `.ai` typically should remain local. If you want it in the repo, consider adding it to git, otherwise add an entry to `.gitignore`.
- If you want, I can produce a single archive `realestates-ai-snapshot.tar.gz` now and place it in the project root for easy download.
